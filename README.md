# CSV-files
# What it built?

A sales data analysis tool that:

1. Generates a dummy sales dataset (Code 1).
2. Loads the sales data from a CSV file, analyzes it, and plots insights (Code 2).

# Why it built?

The tool is built to:

1. Provide a sample sales dataset for testing or demonstration purposes.
2. Analyze sales data and gain insights into revenue by product and over time.

# How it works?

Here's a high-level overview:

1. Data Generation: The first code generates a dummy sales dataset with columns for date, product, quantity, and price.
2. Data Loading: The second code loads the sales data from a CSV file.
3. Data Analysis: The code analyzes the sales data by:
    - Converting the date column to datetime format.
    - Calculating the total revenue by multiplying quantity and price.
    - Grouping the data by product and date, and calculating the total revenue for each group.
4. Plotting Insights: The code creates two plots:
    - A bar chart showing revenue by product.
    - A line plot showing revenue over time.

By combining these two codes, you can generate a sample sales dataset, analyze it, and gain insights into revenue by product and over time.
